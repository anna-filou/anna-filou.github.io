I don't consider myself a writer. I was hesitant about posting my thoughts online because the Internet is already over-saturated with content. What more could I add?

But lately it seems that most  articles are just part of some company’s “content marketing.” It's getting rare to find people who write because they have something to say. 

I'm under no illusion that my thoughts are groundbreaking. Nevertheless I hope you find some of them interesting.
