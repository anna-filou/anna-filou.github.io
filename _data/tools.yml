      they offer more freedom and are way more affordable.

- name: Notion
  url: https://www.notion.so/
  desc:
    en: I use Notion to manage larger projects, because it allows me to create a small
      database with timelines, attachments, to-dos and more and share the entire things
      or sub-pages. I used to use Dropbox Paper for this, but shared pages look really
      weird for people who are not logged in. After Notion added a timeline creation
      feature, there was no reason to keep using Paper.
