tools:
- name: Napkin
  url: https://napkin.one/?via=anna
  img: "/uploads/napkin-logo.jpg"
  desc:
    en: A new tool that helps you *think*, by tagging your thoughts automatically
      in a way that allows for connections to naturally emerge. It fosters serendipity
      by showing you related thoughts and ideas. (Affiliate link, opinion my own.)
    el: ''
- name: Coda
  url: https://coda.io
  desc:
    en: Airtable let me down when I really needed it but Coda was there to catch me
      before I hit the ground. It's way more powerful than I thought and, importantly,
      the app-like “docs” you create with it are easy to use for people who are not
      familiar with databases and storing lots of data in spreadsheets.

- name: Airtable

    en: |-
      I rely on Airtable to run businesses and basically my entire life.

      Update: I mostly use Coda now but Airtable can be better for certain projects.

  desc:
    en: Best design tool for solo and collaborative use. Easy to create interactive
      prototypes. Speeds up development by providing CSS snippets.
    el: ''

- name: Jekyll
  url: https://jekyllrb.com/
  desc:
    en: Instead of bulky CMS that you need to install on your server—like Wordpress—I
      use Jekyll to make super fast, perfectly secure websites that never go down.

- name: Forestry.io CMS
  url: https://forestry.io
  desc:
    en: Easy to use for developers and end-users/clients alike. My headless CMS of
      choice. Generous free tier.
    el: ''

- name: Webflow
  url: https://webflow.com/cms#editors
  desc:
    en: Webflow is an amazing tool that empowers editors/clients to edit content by
      themselves. I mostly use custom code + Jekyll + Forestry CMS nowadays, because
      they offer more freedom and are way more affordable.

- name: Tempo
  url: https://www.yourtempo.co
  desc:
    en: "Tempo is a (now free) macOS/iOS Gmail client. It creates a workspace that
      won't get filled with new emails automatically; you have to manually add them.
      Perfect for those overwhelmed by too many emails. \n\nDisclaimer: I used to
      do customer support for Tempo. The app is no longer maintained but can be used
      indefinitely."

- name: CleanShot X
  url: https://cleanshot.com/
  desc:
    en: Screenshot superpowers for Mac — capture, annotate and, most importantly,
      share screen recordings with ease. I thought the built-in screenshot tool was
      enough, but boy was I wrong!

  desc:
    en: 'Loom makes sharing instructional videos so quick and easy that there''s no
      reason not to. As soon as you''re done shooting, Loom has a shareable link ready
      for anyone to watch. Update: Loom added more limits to their free version, so
      I mostly use CleanShot X now.'

#     en: "Tweek literally changed my life. \U0001F499 I'm a sucker for complicated
#       digital tools but nothing could beat the clarity of using a simple paper planner.
#       Tweek is just like that but with all the advantages of being a digital product.
#       I can't recommend it highly enough!"

- name: 1Feed
  url: https://1feed.app/
  desc:
    en: 'Not just an RSS reader, but THE central hub for all the websites you want
      to check on a regular basis. Instead of overwhelming you with an infinite feed
      of updates, each site takes up just 1 line.

- name: Notion
  url: https://www.notion.so/
  desc:
    en: I use Notion to manage larger projects, because it allows me to create a small
      database with timelines, attachments, to-dos and more and share the entire things
      or sub-pages. I used to use Dropbox Paper for this, but shared pages look really
      weird for people who are not logged in. After Notion added a timeline creation
      feature, there was no reason to keep using Paper.

    en: I buy most domains from iwantmyname. Their service is so easy to use and saves
      you so much time when connecting your domain to other services, like email providers
      and hosting servers.
