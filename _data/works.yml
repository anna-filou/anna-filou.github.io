    In the spirit of using my skills for good, I designed and coded a website to help challenge
    common misconceptions and myths about LGBT+ people. 
    
    It was also an opportunity to experiment with a new aesthetic.

    UX refresh for mobile app + conception of new&nbsp;features.

    *A powerfully simple interface for organized knowledge.*

    I want a note taking app that combines elements from multiple existing apps, 
    and ties them all together with its unique&nbsp;sauce. 
    To get it out of my head, I'm playing around with the idea in&nbsp;Figma.

  description: |    
    Airboxr started its life as a plugin for Google&nbsp;Sheets. 
    To grow the product, the team tasked me with designing a stand-alone web app from&nbsp;scratch.

    My design got the start-up off the ground in 2022 and they’re still going strong 3&nbsp;years&nbsp;later.
