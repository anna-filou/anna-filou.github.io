- title: Concept for Note-Taking App
  description: |
    *A powerfully simple interface for organized knowledge.*

    I want a note taking app that combines elements from multiple existing apps, 
    and ties them all together with its unique&nbsp;sauce. 
    To get it out of my head, I'm playing around with the idea in&nbsp;Figma.

- title: Design for the Airboxr web app
  description: |    
    Airboxr started its life as a plugin for Google&nbsp;Sheets. 
    To grow the product, the team tasked me with designing a stand-alone web app from&nbsp;scratch.

    My design got the start-up off the ground in 2022 and they’re still going strong 3&nbsp;years&nbsp;later.
