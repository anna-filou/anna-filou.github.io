### What do you do professionally?

I design **digital interfaces** and build **websites**. My core skills are user interface and experience design (UI/UX). I have a knack for making complex information easy to understand and powerful interfaces easy to use. 

Currently doing UI Design at [Shopflix](https://shopflix.gr/). Previously managing operations and making sites at [Theeta B.V.](https://theeta.nl), designing at [The Smiling Hippo](https://thesmilinghippo.com) and doing customer support at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co/).

When time allows, I take on **freelance design and development projects** for assorted clients around the world. 

I spent the earlier years of my career managing business operations and building lightweight ERPs for wholesale commerce firms. 

### What makes you tick?

Challenges I can rise up to.

I want to do good in the world. I donâ€™t feel I have yet.

All sorts of projects excite me, but the ones I crave are those thatâ€™ll help others: software that makes your life easier, apps that brighten your day, websites that promote equal rights.

### What else?

I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use and am looking forward to learning how to build them too! 

Online, ~~[I hang out on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@anna_0x)~~ (PH is full of low-quality â€˜productsâ€™ these daysâ€¦), read comics, watch anime, go down rabbit holes of all sorts, and learn how to build things for the web.

Offline, I'm into lifting weights, inline and ice skating, [reading books](/reading/), playing board games, and learning languages, to name a few.
