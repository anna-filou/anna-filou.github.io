### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital native designer and technophile who also makes [illustrations](/{{page.lang}}/graphics) as a hobby.

### What do you do professionally?

I build **websites**, design **digital interfaces**, do product research and organize workflows. My core skills are user interface and experience design (UI/UX).

When I have the time, I take on **freelance design and development projects** for clients around the world.

My rather diverse skill set helps me serve my clients in often unexpected ways. My workflow is **highly organized and meticulous**.

Currently managing growth and operations at [Theeta B.V.](https://theeta.nl) / Previously designing at [The Smiling Hippo](https://thesmilinghippo.com).

### What else?

In my free time I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use. That's the next area I want to explore professionally as well.

In the offline world I'm into inline/ice skating, reading fiction and non-fiction books, playing board games with friends, and learning languages among a myriad of other activities.

Also, I ~~have~~ had a _ridiculously_ annoying but super cute cat. *(She passed away in September 2021…)*
