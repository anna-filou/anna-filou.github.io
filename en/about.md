### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital native designer and technophile [who draws](/{{page.lang}}/graphics).

### What do you do professionally?

I build **websites**, design **digital interfaces**, do product research and organize workflows. My core skills are user interface and experience design (UI/UX).

When I have the time, I take on **freelance design and development projects** for clients around the world.

My rather diverse skill set helps me serve my clients in often unexpected ways. My workflow is **highly organized and meticulous**.

Currently managing growth and operations at [Theeta B.V.](https://theeta.nl) / Previously designing at [The Smiling Hippo](https://thesmilinghippo.com) and doing customer support at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co/).

### What else?

In my free time I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use. That's the next area I want to explore professionally as well.

In the offline world I'm into inline/ice skating, reading fiction and non-fiction books, playing board games with friends, and learning languages among a myriad of other activities.

Also, I ~~have~~ had a _ridiculously_ annoying but super cute cat. _(She passed away in September 2021…)_

### Core values

We all value different qualities. I like reading such lists on other personal websites, so in January 2022 I wrote down the values that are important to me in how I live and work:

#### Authenticity
I hate pretending. I hate reading inflated statements such as “our company’s goal is to bring about global peace” when what you actually do is sell bubblegum. Self-awareness and humility are rare in today's world, but they are qualities I look for in the people and companies I work with.

#### Honesty
I hate lying. I don't want to be impolite; I'm well aware of the importance of not speaking my mind uninvited. But you can be sure that when I say something, I mean it.

#### Curiosity
Nothing good and nothing original can ever be created without a dose of curiosity. “Why is it always done this way? What if we took a different approach? What is the point of including this? What happens if we don’t?”

#### Openness
Transparency. Honesty. Humility. Respect. Those, in my eyes, are all aspects of being open. Open about your purpose, what you do, and who you are. I value this quality in everyone I meet who possesses it.
