### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital native designer and technophile [whoÂ draws](/{{page.lang}}/art).

### What do you do professionally?

I design digital interfaces and build websites. My most developed skills are **UI Design** and **Product Thinking**. 

For me, good user experience isnâ€™t an afterthoughtâ€”itâ€™s the reason I design. While a pleasing UI contributes to UX, itâ€™s only one piece of a much bigger picture.

Currently, Iâ€™m the sole UI Designer at [Shopflix](https://shopflix.gr/), minimizing design debt, creating and maintaining a **Design System**, and balancing it all with business needs.

I have a solid grasp of businees from managing operations and building lightweight ERPs for wholesale firms like [Theeta](https://theeta.nl). I also understand what it takes to serve customers, thanks to my experience handling customer support at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co/).

### What makes you tick?

Challenges I can rise up to.

I want to do good in the world. I donâ€™t feel I have yet.

All sorts of projects excite me, but the ones I crave are those thatâ€™ll help others: software that makes your life easier, apps that brighten your day, websites that promote equal rights.

### What else?

I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use and am looking forward to learning how to build them too! 

Online, ~~[I hang out on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@anna_0x)~~ (PH is full of low-quality â€˜productsâ€™ these daysâ€¦), read comics, watch anime, go down rabbit holes of all sorts, and learn how to build things for the web.

Offline, I'm into lifting weights, inline and ice skating, [reading books](/reading/), playing board games, and learning languages, to name a few.
