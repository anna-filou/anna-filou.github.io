### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital designer who also does [illustration](/{{page.lang}}/graphics) â€” mostly as a hobby at the moment. (But if you want to pay me to draw, I'm game.)

### What do you do professionally?

I do user interface and experience design (UI/UX) at an awesome agency in Greece, called [The Smiling Hippo](https://www.thesmilinghippo.com/).

When I have the time and get an interesting request, I might take on freelance design and development projects for clients around the world.

### What else?

In my free time I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use. That's the next area I want to explore professionally as well.

In the offline world I'm into inline/ice skating, reading fiction and non-fiction books, playing board games with friends, and learning languages among a myriad of other activities.

I used to think that liking and doing many competently different things is a disadvantage; but it turns out it's called being a polymath and is kinda cool.

Also, I have a _ridiculously_ annoying but super cute cat.

### Any parting thoughts?

Wish I could describe myself in a page but that'd be impossible. Do [contact me](/{{page.lang}}/contact) if you want us to get to know each other.
