### Who are you?

I‚Äôm Anna, a naturally curious designer and developer who learned to type before I learned to write. 

I‚Äôm addicted to learning, have high standards, but know how and when to settle for good enough (done is better than perfect).

### What do you do professionally?

I design digital interfaces and build websites. My strongest skills are **UI Design** and **Product Thinking**. 

Currently working at a **Stealth Startup** that I‚Äôm excited to share more about soon! Previously, I was the Product Designer at [Shopflix](/en/shopflix).

I write my own front-end code using **HTML** and **CSS**. I made this website using mostly handwritten markup, [Tachyons CSS](https://tachyons.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). (ChatGPT wrote most of the JavaScript.) I obsess over responsiveness on the web. My pet peeve is websites that break on ‚Äúuncommon‚Äù breakpoints.

### What makes you tick?

Challenges I can rise up to.

I want to do good in the world. I don‚Äôt feel I have yet.

All sorts of projects excite me, but the ones I crave are those that‚Äôll help others: software that makes your life easier, apps that brighten your day, websites that promote equal rights.

### What else?

I love designing and building web apps that scratch my own itches (see [experiments](/en/experiments/) and [ideas](/ideas)) and often spend a worrying amount of time doing just that.

Online, I text with friends, read comics, watch anime, go down rabbit holes of all sorts, and keep learning how to build things for the web.

Offline, I'm into lifting weights, inline and ice skating, [reading books](/reading/), playing board games, and learning languages, to name a few.

While you‚Äôre here, heck out my [bookmarks](/bookmarks) for interesting links I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy diving into.
