### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital native designer and technophile [who draws](/{{page.lang}}/graphics).

### What do you do professionally?

I build **websites**, design **digital interfaces**, do product research and organize workflows. My core skills are user interface and experience design (UI/UX). I have a knack for making complex information easy to understand and powerful interfaces easy to use.

When time allows, I take on **freelance design and development projects** for assorted clients around the world.

My rather diverse skill set helps me serve my clients in often unexpected ways. My workflow is **highly organized and meticulous**.

Currently managing growth and operations at [Theeta B.V.](https://theeta.nl) / Previously designing at [The Smiling Hippo](https://thesmilinghippo.com) and doing customer support at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co/).

### What else?

In my free time I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use. That's the next area I want to explore professionally as well.

In the offline world I'm into inline/ice skating, reading fiction and non-fiction books, playing board games with friends, and learning languages among a myriad of other activities.

Also, I ~~have~~ had a _ridiculously_ annoying but super cute cat. _(She passed away in September 2021…)_
