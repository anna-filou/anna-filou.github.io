### Who are you?

I'm Anna, a digital native designer and technophile [who&nbsp;draws](/{{page.lang}}/graphics).

### What do you do professionally?

I build **websites**, design **digital interfaces**, and run business operations. My core skills are user interface and experience design (UI/UX). I have a knack for making complex information easy to understand and powerful interfaces easy to use.

When time allows, I take on **freelance design and development projects** for assorted clients around the world.

I’m a recovering perfectionist with a diverse skill set. I try my best, but sometimes I get burned out.

Currently managing operations and making sites at [Theeta B.V.](https://theeta.nl) / Previously designing at [The Smiling Hippo](https://thesmilinghippo.com) and doing customer support at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co/).

### What makes you tick?

Challenges I can rise up to.

I want to do good in the world. I don’t feel I have yet.

All sorts of projects excite me, but the ones I crave are those that’ll help others: software that makes your life easier, apps that brighten your day, websites that promote equal rights.

### What else?

I love sketching out concepts for apps I'd want to use. That's also the next area I’m exploring professionally.

Online, I hang out on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/@anna_0x) (more than I probably should), read comics, watch anime, go down rabbit holes of all sorts, and learn how to build things for the web.

Offline, I'm into lifting weights, inline and ice skating, [reading books](/bookshelf/), playing board games, and learning languages, to name a few.
