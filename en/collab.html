  ## Once you contact me‚Ä¶
  1. First, we get on a call to get to know each other and discuss your project. (If you‚Äôre in Athens, Greece, we can meet in person.)
  2. Based on what we discussed on the call, I send you a (short and revisable) proposal with the scope, price and terms of the project.
  3. You sign it electronically, pay the agreed deposit (usually half of the fixed price), and I get to work.

  **Want to get started?**
  Email me at `hello` at `annafilou` dot `com`.
faq:
- q: How much does [X] cost?
  a: I prefer project-based pricing because it aligns my interests with yours 
    (consider that with hourly pricing, the *slower* you get the work done, the *more* you get paid). 
    <br><br>
    The price depends on the specifics of your project.
    That said, the projects I take on are typically in the **1.000‚Äì5.000 ‚Ç¨ range** and my **Minimum Level of Engagement** for any project is **500 ‚Ç¨**. 
- q: Do you work with WordPress, Joomla, ‚Ä¶ etc.?
  a: No. Since complex CMS like WordPress are not necessary for most websites, I work with
    headless CMS. 
    <br><br>
    If you can‚Äôt switch away from your current system, I
    will design your site and your developer of choice will develop it.
- q: Do you make sites on platforms like Wix and Squarespace?
  a: No. I typically develop sites by writing code in a code editor. I can also use [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) or [Framer](https://www.framer.com/), 
    but I don't like working with Wix or similar platforms because of how restrictive they are.
- q: Can you do [XYZ]?
  a: If you have something in mind and don‚Äôt see any examples of it on my site, but
    want to work with me, [hit me up and ask](/en/contact). 
    <br><br>
    I‚Äôm open to new challenges and learn new skills all the time. If I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôll let you know upfront.
