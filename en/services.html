faq:
    - q: Do you charge by the hour?
      a: Almost never. I‚Äôm a big fan of project-based pricing, where you know how much you‚Äôll pay upfront. With hourly pricing the *slower* you get the work done, the *more* you get paid. It motivates you to be slow. But fast is good, right? Then why get paid less for it? ;)
    - q: How much does [X] cost?
      a: It honestly depends on a lot of factors. While I can‚Äôt give you an accurate estimate without hearing the specifics of your project, I can tell you right now that if you‚Äôre looking for someone who charges rock bottom prices, it‚Äôs not me. I value my time and I value yours too. My most recent projects were in the 1.000‚Äì3.000 ‚Ç¨ range.
    - q: Do you speak my language?
      a: Currently, I can speak English, Greek and German (in that order of proficiency). 
    - q: Can you do [XYZ]?
      a: If you have something in mind and don‚Äôt see any examples of it on my site, but want to work with me, hit me up and ask. I‚Äôm open to new challenges and learn new skills all the time. If I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôll let you know upfront.

        <p>I‚Äôll bet you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôre looking to commission creative work.</p>
        <p>I can tell you all about my skills and process (and I will) but allow me to let you in on a secret: </p>
        <p class="blockquote">The most important thing when working with a freelancer is how well you get along with each other.</p>
        <p>So let‚Äôs get acquainted! üòÅ Reply to my little video and I‚Äôll get back to you right away. I get genuinely excited each time someone reaches out to me and do my absolute best to serve them, if I can. If not, we both walk away having met somebody new ‚Äî and isn‚Äôt that the most interesting part of life?</p>
