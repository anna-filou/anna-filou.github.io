    ## Once you contact me‚Ä¶
    1. First, we get on an introductory (video) call to get to know each other a bit and discuss your needs. (If you‚Äôre in Athens, Greece, we can meet in person.)
    2. Respecting what we discussed on the call, I send you a (revisable) proposal with the scope, price and terms of the project.
    3. You sign it electronically, pay the agreed deposit (usually half of the fixed price), and I get to work.

    **Sounds good?**
    Email me at `hello`-at-`annafilou`-dot-`com` or [reply to my video above](#).

faq:
    - q: Do you charge by the hour?
      a: Almost never. I‚Äôm a big fan of project-based pricing, where you know how much you‚Äôll pay upfront. With hourly pricing the *slower* you get the work done, the *more* you get paid. It motivates you to be slow. But if fast is good, why get paid less for it? ;)
    - q: How much does [X] cost?
      a: It honestly depends on many factors. While I can‚Äôt give you an accurate estimate without hearing the specifics of your project, I can tell you that if you‚Äôre looking for someone who charges rock bottom prices, it‚Äôs not me. I value my time and I value yours too. My most recent web projects were in the 1.000‚Äì5.000 ‚Ç¨ range.
    - q: Do you work with WordPress, Joomla, ‚Ä¶ etc.?
      a: No. Complex CMS like WordPress are not necessary for most websites. I work with headless CMS like Forestry. If you can‚Äôt switch away from your current CMS, I can do your site‚Äôs design and your developer of choice will develop it.
    - q: Can you do [XYZ]?
      a: If you have something in mind and don‚Äôt see any examples of it on my site, but want to work with me, hit me up and ask. I‚Äôm open to new challenges and learn new skills all the time. If I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôll let you know upfront.
