    ## Once you contact me…
    1. First, we get on an introductory (video) call to get to know each other a bit and discuss your needs. (If you’re in Athens, Greece, we can meet in person.)
    2. Respecting what we discussed on the call, I send you a (revisable) proposal with the scope, price and terms of the project.
    3. You sign it electronically, pay the agreed deposit (usually half of the fixed price), and I get to work.

    **Sounds good?**
    Email me at `hello`-at-`annafilou`-dot-`com` or [reply to my video above](#).

faq:
    - q: Do you charge by the hour?
      a: Almost never. I’m a big fan of project-based pricing, where you know how much you’ll pay upfront. With hourly pricing the *slower* you get the work done, the *more* you get paid. It motivates you to be slow. But fast is good, right? Then why get paid less for it? ;)
    - q: How much does [X] cost?
      a: It honestly depends on a lot of factors. While I can’t give you an accurate estimate without hearing the specifics of your project, I can tell you right now that if you’re looking for someone who charges rock bottom prices, it’s not me. I value my time and I value yours too. My most recent web projects were in the 1.000–5.000 € range.
    - q: Do you work with WordPress, Joomla, … etc.?
      a: No. I believe that complex CMS like WordPress are not necessary for the majority of (but not all) websites. If you really can’t switch away from your current CMS, I can do your site’s design and your developer of choice will develop it.
    - q: Do you speak my language?
      a: Currently, I can speak English, Greek and German (in that order of proficiency). 
    - q: Why is your email written in a weird way?
      a: Spammers use automated software tools (bots) that scan websites and find email addresses. I write my email like this — `hello`-at-`annafilou`-dot-`com` — in an attempt to hide it from such bots.
    - q: Can you do [XYZ]?
      a: If you have something in mind and don’t see any examples of it on my site, but want to work with me, hit me up and ask. I’m open to new challenges and learn new skills all the time. If I can’t do it, I’ll let you know upfront.

        <p>I get genuinely excited each time someone reaches out to me and do my absolute best to serve them, if I can. If not, we both walk away having met somebody new — and isn’t that the most interesting part of life? 😁</p>
