# This is my Personal Site
It's a constant work in progress. Designed and built in Webflow.
Currently looking into building a new site using:
- a statsic site generator (Jekyll or Middleman)
- a static CMS (Netlify CMS or Forestry)

To-do for new website/portfolio:
- [x] design the site with all the pages in Webflow
- [x] export the HTML, CSS and JS files
- [x] paste it into a Jekyll build
- [x] create the folder structure needed to it to work
- [ ] add Liquid and frontmatter to the pages
- [ ] Translate into GR and DE
- [ ] Separate the text from the HTML so that I can adit MD files to make changes
- [ ] Connect with a static CMS to edit frontmatter and MD files
- [ ] Upload new site
