# Personal Portfolio
## Work in Progress

Here is where I test and "debug" my new portfolio before I copy everything to my main repo.

[Temporary Netlify Link](https://new-portfolio-test.netlify.com/)

- Built with: Jekyll
- Design/Frontend: Webflow

### To-do:
- [x] fix flag images
- [x] update text (MD files)
- [x] research lightboxes (Webflow's default is bad)
  - [x] implement different lightbox (Fancybox)
- [ ] template the code for the website examples so that I can edit them through MD files (own folder)
