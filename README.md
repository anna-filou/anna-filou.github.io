# This is my Personal Site
It's a constant work in progress. Designed and built in Webflow.
Currently looking into building a new site using:
- a statsic site generator (Jekyll or Middleman)
- a static CMS (Netlify CMS or Forestry)

To do that I plan to:
- [ ] design in Webflow
- [ ] export the HTML, CSS and JS files
- [ ] paste it into a Jekyll build
- [ ] create the folder structure needed to it to work
- [ ] add Liquid and frontmatter to the pages
- [ ] configure the _config.yml so that the Liquid variables will work
