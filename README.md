### The future

I don't exactly _dislike_ my current website but it's honesty not great. I've improved a lot since the day I published it and that's not reflected in its design.

As soon I have more free time, I plan to update it. But I'm paralyzed by the options. There are so many styles I like, I don't know which direction to follow. I try things, don't like them, try something else, it doesn't feel like meâ€¦ and so on.
