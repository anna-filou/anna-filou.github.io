How you organize your Figma files, team and library depends on your organizations’s structure, design project size, and the personal preferences of everyone involved.

Seems obvious, but I spent months looking for the “perfect way”, when it never existed. 

What works for me, for the time being, is the following:

I use 3 Figma files:

1. ⚛ System (❖ Team Library) — All components, including entire pages
2. 🖌️ Design — Explorations. Once we have a final design, I update or create the relevant components in the system file.
3. 👩🏻‍💻 Dev — Almost exclusively made up of component instances from the System file.

Why? When I update a component’s or a page’s design while working on a specific feature or flow, the update is pushed to the design pages for all the other features and flows too. So we no longer run into issues where someone says “This page looks a little different on Flow A than on Flow B. Which one are we going with?”

Now, to be honest, I have some ❖ components in the Design file as well (so that’s a Team Library too, when it shouldn‘t), but I move them to the System file whenever I have the chance.
