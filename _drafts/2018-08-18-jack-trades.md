*My compulsion to do everything and do it well.*

It started nearly two years ago. I woke up to the sound of my phone ringing a bit before noon. My best friend sounded so excited as she shouted “I got you a job!” I was confused.

She explained: “a shareholder of the restaurant I’m working at is looking for a secretary who speaks German and knows her way around computers. He is practically looking for you! You’ll even get to travel as part of the job!”

I kept my expectations low. I was 19. My biggest career achievement was graduating from a public high-school with average to low grades. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But why not go for a quick interview? It’ll be over in 15 minutes and then I’m free to go eat downtown.

Turns out, I was a bit too straight-forward in my texting with my potential future employer. I ended up insulting him. See, small talk and politeness do not come easy to me.

To make a long story short, one month later, he had yet to find someone right for the job. He invited me to his office and decided to hire me…

At first I was told I’d be responsible for sales and communicating with clients, existing and potential, on behalf of his new wholesale company. Despite that, I was constantly being asked to do all sorts of unrelated things. There was a lot of adjusting; I needed to do tons of learning in my free time just to not fall behind and lose “everything”.

One very specific example: the company had no website. When I asked if it did, I was told that yes, of course it does. In reality, it was a terribly put-together Wix atrocity. (Wix is a great service, but the person who made that specific site must have not had an ounce of common sense.)

I *had* to fix that.

The thought of our clients looking us up online and laying their eyes upon… that was too embarrassing to stand. Problem was, I did not know a thing about web design or development. Well, not really a problem, per se, more like an opportunity.

Everything else was immediately moved aside to make room for my #1 goal: Figuring out how to make a respectable website for the company and thus avoid further embarrassment.

Where to even begin? Well, learning to code well in a short amount of time while working full time (and often overtime) was pretty much out of the question. I started looking into visual website builders and learning the basics of HTML. & CCS to be able to make small tweaks if needed.

Eventually, version 1.0 was ready. I showed my boss. He didn’t like the color. Then he didn’t like the lack of pictures. Then he said the Wix one was better because it had the company logo on top of a TV mockup (not even in it, they were on different layers and there was a parallax scrolling effect but whatever)! Once I changed a few things though, he loved it.

Yet I was not satisfied. I usually have enough self-awareness to look past my excitement and see things they way they are. From that day onward, tweaking the website until it looked professional and respectable became my side-goal. I’ve learned so much by constantly making changes, reading articles about design and user experience, searching for tools that do what I know is possible (read: I spend a lot of time on Product Hunt).

Reading about design became my default pastime. Out of (perceived) necessity and out of passion. I still don’t consider myself a great designer since there’s a big difference between reading and doing, but I digress.

Let’s not forget that that was not at all related to my main job. At home I’d be spending so much time to develop my design skills and put them to use to serve the company. At work I had to speak with clients, make sales, issue invoices and organize documents. Needless to say, I had to find better ways of doing all the “work things” as well.

My time got split into lots of tiny pieces: Research on cloud invoicing software, research on building landing pages, testing out various email clients, Excel tutorials, research on CMRs, messing around with databases, testing task management apps, learning design principles… The list goes on and it’s pretty long.

Somehow I managed to improve on everything I tried to. Of course I suspect that the improvement would have been much greater and faster if I’d focused on a couple of things at a time. Unfortunately, that was simply not possible as I had to be doing all of them at work every day.

Long story short, I’m now at a point where I have in-depth knowledge in many completely unrelated topics. My skills are diverse, but none of them mastered or anywhere close to that.

I keep telling myself that one day I’ll find a way to combine my scattered pieces of knowledge in a meaningful way. I don’t know how much truth that holds. It takes effort to prevent myself from feeling overwhelmed and worthless. I see the worth what I do could have if only I were better at it. But "it" is never a single thing.

I cook, I bake, I draw, illustrate, paint with watercolors, paint digitally, write emails, essays, troubleshoot, offer tech support, manage stock in different warehouses, make invoices, call clients, do some accounting, make websites, dabble a bit in marketing, send newsletters, build databases, draw comics, design tattoos, and SO MUCH MORE.

Do you see a pattern? I don’t. Everything I do, I want to do well. If I start building something, I need to learn how to perfect it. I need to spend days researching, trying out different ideas, tweaking details… It’s never "let’s do this thing and get on with life." It’s always "let’s find the best way I can possibly do this and then do it" even if it’s something relatively unimportant and not at all aligned with my values and goals.

I take it all on. Perhaps because I’m afraid to say no, possibly to prove something and arguably because I don’t trust other people to do it well.

The stupid aspect of this whole situation is that I often do a bad job at something, because I’m no expert (and frankly don’t need to be.) Then instead of looking for a ready-made solution (i.e. paying someone who’s already nailed) or delegating the task, I feel like I have to do it myself, like I have to get better. If that means spending hours, days, or weeks to gather knowledge and develop the skills, then so be it.

Truth be told, I’m not sure how common that is. Maybe everybody feels like that but doesn’t talk about it. Perhaps I’m under the illusion that I’m facing unique challenges while everybody deals with very similar issues. I’ll never know if I never tell anyone. So I am.
My Dream Life (as I imagine it at the moment)

What does it take for a person like me to be content? A person who wants to excel at everything and feels compelled to do it all alone?

I understand that that desire and those "urges" if you will are irrational and only set me back. My default mentality is "if you want something done right, do it yourself" but I know that’s not always the case. I’m not good at everything. I’m barely even good at the things I like doing. Trying to perfect skills I won’t use again, or that don’t contribute to my bettering myself or getting closer to a life I want to live… I don’t enjoy that. It’s a compulsion.

I do realize that real life can never be exactly like the motivational lifestyle pictures that float around online. But I’d like the freedom to focus on what I deem important at any given moment. By that I don’t mean I’d be chasing a different passion every day; quite the opposite.
I go through periods in my life when I feel extremely drawn to a particular activity or project. Some of my favorite activities are drawing, designing and installing different ROMs (tweaked versions of the Android operating system) & mods on phones. I don’t always feel like doing all these things though. For example, I haven’t messed around with a phone like that in almost a year. I’m busy with other things, and I don’t feel drawn to it. Once I get too fed up with my phone, I know I’ll feel compelled to spend days looking into all the custom ROMs available. But until then, I just don’t engage in that activity.

Likewise, even though I love drawing, I often let months pass without drawing a single thing. Without cooking a single meal, without baking a single cake. All the things I enjoy, I don’t want to do all the time. I am much more happy and productive when I focus. Do one thing, all the time, for two weeks straight. Then take a break. Then repeat. Perhaps switch to something different for a while. Then back to the first thing. Then a third one. Give myself time to make tangible progress.

I don’t believe in multitasking. It’s impossible and trying is counter-productive. And yet I am required to multitask at work. It’s not like anybody is directly asking me to. But how do you focus with a phone that rings every 5 minutes? With clients, accountants and superiors on the other side of the line who all have unique problems that need solutions?

Ideally, it wouldn’t be like that at all. There’d be flexibility to focus on whatever would require my attention at the time. My work would be project-oriented and would not depend on my being available at all times and responsible for various unrelated tasks. I’d be good at numerous things but remarkable in only one or two. My life would be focused around certain things; presumably love, work (and making a difference through it), travel and health. From where I’m standing, that seems to be all one needs to live happily and fulfilledly.

**So I plan to focus.**

Focus on what makes me tick, what makes me feel excited at the start of a new day. Question now is, will I make it? I still have to juggle work obligations, the office, and personal goals. As long as I have loads of isolated responsibilities and no precise long-term goal to concentrate on, how do I focus?

I suppose we’ll see; I image I’m going to figure it out, but right now the answer seems uncertain. What’s unquestionable is that things will have to change, or no progress will be made.
