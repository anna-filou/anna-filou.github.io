In the past years a lot of female-only social networks have popped up. Some of them for professional networking and others for companionship. (I'm not including dating apps.)

I have to admit I don't know if the people who make those networks honestly believe that what they're doing is good or if they just want the publicity, a way to set their social network apart from the rest.

But I do think they should ask themselves if they're the change they want to see in the world, or if they're doing their part in holding society back.

**Imagine** someone telling black people that, to avoid racism, they should only socialize with other black people in “black-only” social networks and in-person events. That they should only seek black roommates, black clients, black employers, and black friends. Does that sound like a good idea to anyone with half a brain? Hopefully not.

You see, it used to be *just* like that and we had a term for it: racial **segregation**. The most blatantly obvious manifestation of racism.

It used to be a bit like that with men and women too and sadly in some ways, it still is. Only it's not legally enforced (excluding public bathrooms for a reason I’ll never understand), but rather people choose to *segregate* *themselves*. 

> By socializing only with others who look like us, we end up believing that the ones who don't are different on the inside as well.

The reality is that biological sex is part of our *appearance*, not our personality. I'll go out on a limb and guess that you don't believe being blonde, blue-eyed, tall or short is an indicator of any of your personality traits. And yet many think that sex is. 

Why? 

“But,” I can hear many saying, “men and women are *biologically different!”* 

So are tall people compared to short people. So are people with red hair compared to those with brown hair! So WHAT? You don’t assign personality traits and interests to those other “biological differences.” Every single person is biologically/genetically different from every other person. Even identical twins can have vastly different personalities despite sharing almost their entire genetic code.

There’s nothing wrong in seeking people you have more in common with sometimes.
What’s dangerous is accenuating perceived differences between groups, when they are in fact tiny — if they exist at all.

We’re running in circles.
First, women are thought to be so different from men that they’re treated almost like objects. 
Then a revolution: women are the same as men! 
We’re all human!
But we need to sell more stuff, so let’s go back to “women are so different”.
Can we exit the circle and start going forward already?

I’ll share the taglines of some “female—only” services I’ve stumbled upon on Product Hunt (*emphasis* mine):

- leap.club — A community-led professional network for women

    - “Shello was founded to create *a sanctuary for women* to share their questions, knowledge and views without the judgement … and grow their *female network* in the process.”

Most of these feature the phrase “empower women” somewhere in their marketing. 
Very accurate, if by ‘empower’ they mean ‘turn into better marketing targets’.
