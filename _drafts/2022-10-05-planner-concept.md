    As a potential customer, I wasn’t aware of all the different Monster Energy sub-brands (Dragon Tea, Muscle Monster etc.) so I highlighted some of the less-known flavors, and included a vivid description of what drinking Monster Energy is supposed to feel like.

    I gave the “Monster Army” program its own section, since it shows that Monster isn’t all talk about helping athletes live their dream and promotes positive feelings towards the brand.

    Ideally, visitors who feel that the brand’s mission resonates with them would follow Monster Energy on social media to be kept up to date on promotions, new products and events.

    To that end, I put a preview of the brand’s Instagram feed on the bottom of the page, above the footer.

    Right below that is the footer, where visitors can access additional pages, subscribe to the newsletter (which they can also do at the News section), and change the site’s language in case the IP location-based system gets it wrong.

    The old homepage looks dated, a bit bland and frankly kinda boring. Not to mention the overlapping text elements, lack of images in the social feed, tiny margins, low contrast buttons and other visual and accessibility issues.

    People with a passing interest in the Monster Energy drinks, sponsored sports or events would likely lose interest and leave.

    The images don’t look enticing, although Monster posts many fantastic photos on their social media. The news section feels cramped, many titles get cut off and it’s impossible to visit a specific news category.

    I can’t imagine anyone telling their friends to check out the current page.
