A client of mine in the transportation business had previously ordered a website from another company. 

The first thing on the homepage? A full-screen image carousel with stock photos, including a couple looking at a map, their faces hidden. No contact form anywhere on the site; instead, instructions on what kind of info to send via email.

This is what happens when you take a generic template, change the text and images, and sell it as a “custom website”.

## The difference

**Typical cheap websites (300—500 €):** 
- Generic template
- Minor tweaks to colors and photos
- Flashy effects that make the site slow and hard to use

See: [Google Search for “free bootstrap templates”](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=free+bootstrap+templates&udm=2)

**My custom websites:** 
- Designed around your business goals
- Fast, readable, and functional
- Built from scratch for **you**, not limited by pre-made solutions

See: [Some of my work](/{{page.lang}}/#work)

## What custom website means
- **Purposeful design**: Every page and element exists for a reason. No filler.
- **Logical structure**: If you're a restaurant, your menu is easily accessible. If you're a lawyer, your services are crystal clear.
- **Good user experience**: Visitors find what they’re looking for quickly, so they don’t get frustrated or give up.

## I didn’t start out as a designer
Before I got into web development, I worked in supply chain and business operations. I’ve struggled with clunky interfaces that get in the way of doing your job or finding what you need. Now I’m trying to eliminate that kind of experience, one website at a time. 

I don’t aim for work that only “looks good”; it must also work well.

## Why 1.000 € minimum

To deliver a website that actually has real value for you, I need:

- Time to study and understand your business
- Custom design and development
- Testing across devices
- Attention to detail and content structure
- Technical optimization for speed and SEO

If I charged less, I’d have to cut corners or use templates to make it viable. I have no interest in doing either.

## The bottom line

I don't build cheap websites because cheap websites don't work.

If you’re just looking for the lowest price, there are plenty of options out there. If you want something well thought-out and tailored to your business, let’s talk.

## Note

Most of my recent work isn’t websites, but designing interfaces for apps and internal tools as part of in-house teams. That kind of work is priced differently (monthly or hourly).

But when someone asks me for a website, the first question is almost always: “How much will it cost?” Sometimes followed by: “I know someone who does it for 500 €.”

That’s why I wrote this post to explain what I do, how I work, and why the price is what it is.
