    A list of rough (mostly software) ideas I’d like to work on, in no particular order. Do you have any similar ones? Let’s&nbsp;collab! 
    
    Note: this list is **incomplete** — there are too many ideas to list, and I have to consolidate them in one place too.

- **Nested Kanban** project manager. Imagine Trello, but clicking a card opens its own Kanban board.
- **Hourly time tracker** — [see my concept prototype](/en/time-tracker-concept)
- **Recording app** that records everything for 1–2 running hours, then you can choose to save the last 5, 10, 20 etc. minutes. (Similar to [Backtrack](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backtrack-record-the-past/id1477089520?mt=12), but for mobile.) Could also be a physical device that syncs with the cloud/your phone.
- A browser extension that shows you a **searchable list of your other extensions** (should be built into browsers IMO).
- **Notes app you can converse with**. My biggest pain point with existing note taking applications is that, when I search for something, I often don't remember the exact words that I used within the note. I would like to search in natural language and have the app surface results that might not use the exact words but match the query (similar to how Gmail does it). For example, maybe I wrote about something being “inexpensive” but now I'm searching for “cheap”— it should still turn up. 
    
    I'd also like to ask full questions and have the app return answers that consolidate knowledge from various notes and are aware of relative dates. ([Voicenotes](https://voicenotes.com/) comes very close to achieving this.) Just an example: Say I'm keeping a daily journal and one day I ask “how was my December in 2022?” I'd like a response like “While there were some negatives in December (you were very stressed about work and didn't sleep much) it was a good month overall since you spent more time with friends than usual.”
- A **travel website** where you choose a destination and dates it shows you the total price for the flights, a hotel, and eating out, so you can compare destinations based on your budget.
- Minimal **Android launcher** like Indistractible + Before (quarantines notifications), but with app icons and an app drawer similar to Smart Launcher (auto categorization). 
- **Calorie tracking app** where there’s ONLY one version of any food (one apple, one banana, one chicken thigh, etc.) — Easier to log food and keep up the habit.
- RPG character **stat tracking app**, but the character is IRL you (think skill charts!)
- App that syncs with your **Google contacts** two-way and lets you add notes and todos
- Journal app for therapists. They can make an account for each client. The therapist sees all client journal entries in one app. The client only sees theirs. Custom prompts, multiple journals per client.
- Modern redesign of [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) — I love how it works but not how it looks
- Notes app that looks like texting app (each recipient = a notebook)
- Screenshot organizer with OCR and object recognition. A beefed up version of [Firefox ScreenshotGo](https://firefox-screenshotgo.en.uptodown.com/android) for Android ([deprecated](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/iz2i57/why_firefox_screenshotgo_was_abandoned/)). A few have tried but none of the solutions have stuck around (or even launched!). Currently I sync my phone screenshots with my MacBook using Google Drive + [DriveSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync&hl=en-US), so the text in them is indexed by Spotlight.
- **Threaded messaging app**. Think of Slack threads as first-class citizens: you start a conversation by creating a titled thread for a topic, such as a trip, a movie night, or a philosophical concept. Those threads appear in-line in your chat, but there’s also a separate tab where you can see, sort, and search all threads. That way, you can have topic-specific discussions in addition to general 1-on-1 and group chats!
- **Routine app** where you can create a multi step process with timed steps. E.g. “getting ready to go to the office” would have tasks like `make coffee - 8 min`, `drink coffee - 10 min`, `brush teeth - 3 min`, `get dressed - 6 min`, and so on. I know there many apps “ADHD planner” apps that do this (in theory) but none of them work well IMO (too complex and/or inflexible).
