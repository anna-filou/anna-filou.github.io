Since 2023, I've been the only UI / Product Designer at SHOPFLIX.gr, a major Greek e-commerce marketplace.

I was initially brought on for UI Design, but over time my role evolved into what we now call Product Design, spanning everything from visual design to component systems and behavior analytics.

When I tell people where I work, I always append it with **"but what you see on the website isn't what I've designed!"** The public-facing UI is still full of legacy design debt — but that’s exactly what I’ve been working to change.

I can't share details due to NDA (😮‍💨), but here's the gist of my two years at Shopflix:

### Year 1
I spent most of my time patching up existing designs as they were being implemented, and rushing to design new features using problematic components in the name of “consistency.” Alongside that I was creating ad-hoc marketing assets while building a component library in Figma and laying the foundations of a design system on the side. Due to ever-looming deadlines, rethinking flows was off the table. I hated adapting work I believed was poorly thought-out.

But I developed something unique: an architecture where entire pages function as reusable components. Instead of just designing buttons and cards, **I made complete pages that I could drop into any flow, ensuring all user journeys would always display the latest version**. This solved a major development issue: devs might start working on a feature many months after I designed it, and by then there could be updates to pages within that flow. Before this approach, developers kept accidentally rolling back each other's work.

Here's the component system in action:

### Year 2
With a major deadline gone, I finally had the freedom to explore and pitch improvements, on both personal itches and real user behavior. But most of my usability-focused proposals got shelved. I measured potential improvements through heuristic evaluation and informal testing—asking people around me to describe what they saw and what they'd assume different elements would do, trying not to bias their responses.

That phase taught me as much about organizational dynamics as it did about design. I learned the importance of getting colleagues on your side, being convincing and motivating. I built stakeholder buy-in by consistently shipping good work, sharing honest opinions, and pushing back when needed. I also got involved with anything I could help improve, even outside my defined role.

That persistence is paying off because now things are shifting again. I'm excited about what's coming and cautiously optimistic I'll finally be building a platform I'm proud to be associated with.

On to Year 3.
