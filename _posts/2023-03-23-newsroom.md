intro: 'The Newsroom is a small start-up with a big mission: reduce bias in news reporting
by highlighting multiple perspectives across publications.'
sections:
- title: Goal
  text: 'The founders tasked me with redesigning parts of the app within a short time
    frame, while loosely staying within the current design framework. The goal was
    clear: increase user retention by making the app easier to use and its features
    more discoverable.'
- title: Background
  text: "In user interviews conducted by the Newsroom, some key issues came up: \n\n-
    On the main page, many did not know you can swipe on a story’s picture to read
    summary cards, nor that you can click on blocks for an in-depth article view.\n-
    On the article page, some didn’t realize you could swipe through tabs to view
    multiple perspectives (the standout feature of the Newsroom) and sources.\n\nIn
    addition, the vast majority of people who downloaded the app only opened it once
    and did not come back."

- title: Process
  text: After analyzing the feedback, I started making sketches for alternative layouts
    and new features. The ideas were polished through asynchronous discussion with
    the founders and eventually turned into a high-fidelity prototype.

- title: Improvements (1)
  text: "**Home screen** \n- Added a weekly calendar row to show people which days
    they have already read, encouraging the formation of a daily habit.\n- Separated
    the image of the story blocks from the text cards and made it clear that swiping
    is an option, improving discoverability.\n- Added the titles of the multiple perspectives
    to the main page, so users know what to expect before diving in, improving transparency."

- title: Improvements (2)
  text: "**Story page** \n\nOpted for a long page with anchor links for easy navigation,
    ensuring that the different sections are unmissable. \n\n**Search page** \n\nYou
    can now quickly get an overview of relevant articles and see which ones have multiple
    perspectives (the key differentiating factor of the Newsroom)."

- title: Outcome
  text: |-
    The redesign was well-received by the client, who was impressed by the improved usability and discoverability of the app's key features. Some changes were implemented within days, while others will be tested and fine-tuned before release.

    More importantly, by implementing these changes, the Newsroom will be better positioned to compete as a unique challenger in the highly competitive sector of news apps and achieve its mission.
