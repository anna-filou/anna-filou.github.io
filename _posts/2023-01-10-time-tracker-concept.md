intro: I used to wonder where my time went. I tried personal time trackers, but they were and cumbersome. I liked the concept of an hourly tracker, and made my own.

    A strip at the top, colored to represent the change of the sky's color during course of a day, reminds you how long you have left until the day is over.

    Each hour is assigned an icon besed on the activity you type, to give you a quick overview of your day when you look back.

    A line visually separates hours past, from time yet to come, grounding you.

- title: Working prototype
  text: |-
    I quickly made a working prototype in [Coda](https://coda.io) (where I don't have much control over the design), which Iâ€™ve been using every day since. I find I'm more mindful about how I spend my time because I mentally check in with myself during the day, in order to log my time later.
