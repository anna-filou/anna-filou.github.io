    I led the design transformation of Airboxr from a limited Google Sheets add-on to a robust web application.

    The result? Airboxr attracted high-value clients and built a flexible component library, empowering the team to add new features seamlessly, even years after the 2022 launch.

    Airboxr began as a Google Sheets add-on. While functional, it struggled with discoverability and usability—few users are even aware of add-ons, and the format imposed significant limitations.

    The goal was to reimagine Airboxr as an intuitive web app capable of pulling data from multiple sources, delivering automated insights, and providing a seamless, beginner-friendly experience.

    Collaborating closely with the founder, who provided early user feedback, I designed a comprehensive web application from scratch (0→1).

    Key features include:
    - A interface built on top of Google Sheets for running and creating “hops”—custom recipes that pull data from multiple sources into Google Sheets, with predefined sorting and filtering rules.
    - A main app comprising:
      - A dashboard showcasing automatically generated insights.
      - An integrations page for connecting data sources.
      - A marketplace for discovering pre-built hops.
