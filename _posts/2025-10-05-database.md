[Databaseâ„¢](https://www.instagram.com/thedatabase.co/) has already established itself as a trusted resource for digital designers. When [Constantinos Haritos](https://www.haritos.co/), the Brand Designer who created it, asked me for some help with the Design System for the upcoming web platform, I was super excited to contribute.

The design of the platform was mostly complete, and I turned the designs into reusable components and responsive styles. I also created some tricky internal pages and flows using the newly established design patterns.
