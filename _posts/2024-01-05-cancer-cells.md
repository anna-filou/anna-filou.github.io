I came across this [captivating article comparing capitalism to cancer](https://spencerrscott.substack.com/p/if-capitalism-is-a-cancer-what-are), which goes deeper than others have.

When cancer kills its host, it dies too; but tumor cells are shielded from the body and unaware of their reliance on it. Similarly, humans under capitalism resemble tumor cells, each generation indoctrinated with ideas of constant growth and seeking more wealth, fame, and status. We city dwellers rarely consider our trash production and its impact—out of sight, out of mind. 

Though we possess foresight, unlike cancer cells, we still thoughtlessly contribute to an unsustainable system that harms us. Secretly, we just hope it won't collapse in our lifetimes. 

But even ignoring climate change's implications for our generation, the social aspects remain undeniably problematic. Things must change because even if they don't worsen, they're already bad enough. 

At 26, despite doing well in my career and leading a comfortable life, I’m not satisfied. Guilt arises when I try to rest or enjoy time with my partner. Leisure is no longer the goal of work but rather a means to boost productivity. The idea has shifted from “be productive to go on vacation” to “go on vacation to be more productive.”

Some of my friends have relocated abroad for better jobs. To see my best friend, I have to wait for summer each year. Our system pushes relocation to more affluent places, scattering us apart. Not that moving is bad in itself. It's just often not a choice you make to improve your living conditions, but one you make to survive.

This isn’t the good life. Life's meaning lies in our relationships with others. Most of us yearn for connection and friendship; but how can we find happiness without life's most meaning-inducing aspect?

I didn't choose this cancer; I was born into it. Yet I’m complacent. My self-worth hinges on productivity. If my creations fail to meet standards, I feel awful. Only when producing something worthy do I feel content (for a short while). But this mindset isn't innate to humans. Looking at other primates and animals shows it's not our nature—so it must be the system.
