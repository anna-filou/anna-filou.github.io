    Online arguments on the topic of LGBT rights often cascade into a heated back-and-forth of personal attacks.

    I **made a website** that debunks misconceptions in a polite and understanding way, as you might try to explain to your prejudiced—but actually kind—relatives.

    **What's the goal behind this?** Honestly, I mostly just wanted to get it out of my head; to encapsulate arguments I've vocalized on the spot countless times. 
    
    Maybe this will be the spark that prompts someone to question what they've assumed to be true because everyone around them believes it—and if so, then it will have been worth my time.

    I was taking a course on branding, and the capstone project was to create a brand and website design for a fictional organization—the only requirement? It would have to support a socially beneficial cause. 
    
    “LGBT myths” just popped into my head instantly. I stopped caring about the course and never finished it; I just wanted to make the site. I was hugely surprised that the domain LGBTmyths.com was available. I bought it, opened Figma, and got to work.

    I want to translate every post into other languages so that it can make an impact where it’s most needed. The people most likely to believe these myths are the least likely to speak English.

    Behind the scenes, the website is built with Jekyll and has two collections: `_myths` and `_faqs`. Because Jekyll doesn't have built-in localization support, I’d have to manually create a copy of every page for each language. Since that’s error-prone, I’m looking into alternatives. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/i18n/) is one option, but I recently got [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) to build me a plugin with Ruby that automates the manual process with Jekyll!
