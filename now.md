* Feeling a bit burnt out and disillusioned. Not in the mood to do much. And yet I’m thinking of revamping this site. Maybe that’ll make me feel better.
* Finally started watching Rick and Morty and love it.
* Determined to finish Zelda: BOTW, after 3+ years of playing XD
* “In love” with the [Pi chatbot](https://pi.ai/talk) by [Inflection](https://inflection.ai)
* I’m worried about my eyesight getting worse rapidly… No wonder, with all the staring at screens at close distance.
* Got a [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) invite after *many* months of being on the waitlist — but I’ve switched jobs in the meantime and don't need it anymore! ^^; Still a useful tool I think I’ll enjoy using. 
* Also trying out [Twos](https://www.twosapp.com) which is like a digital bullet journal. Although it seems the most effectlive way for me to get stuff done is to keep separate notebooks for each area of like (e.g. work notebook, home notebook).
