* Started learning Javascript.
* Talking with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), perhaps a bit too much.
* Working out at home.  
* Getting my thinking in order.
  * Getting used to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Napkin](https://napkin.one/?via=anna).
* Thinking about what I want out of 2023 (and more specifically, the next 3 months.)
