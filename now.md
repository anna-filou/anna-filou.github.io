    I recently left [Shopflix](/en/shopflix) after 2.5 years and, as of today, Iâ€™m working at a stealth startup Iâ€™m very excited about! ðŸŒŸ

    I've been thinking about what I want more of in my life, and the answer includes **free time** to engage with my favorite people and hobbies. To that end, Iâ€™m not taking on any client work for the forseeable future to maintain my focus and sanity. 
    
    Some of my newfound free time has gone into [reading a lot of books](/reading). Soon, some of it will hopefully go into seeing my friends more often, **SLEEPING**, planning and going on trips, working out and âœ¨relaxingâœ¨.

    And then, after I've recharged a bit, I really wanna work on some personal projects and [ideas](/ideas) that I've had in mind for a while. I recently made [Today Todo](https://today.annafilou.com/), which I've had in mind as an app idea for months! I'd love to do more of that.
