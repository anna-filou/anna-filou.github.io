# Now Page

In this page you can find out what is going on in my life at the moment.
Inspired by the [Now Now Now Project](https://nownownow.com/about).

## 🌍 Current Location
- Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹
- Just moved into a new apartment in the city center! 🛋️📦🚚

While I'm here I do my best not to eat a lot of junk (🍰🍫🍪) and hope to keep it up regardless of my location.

It's get harder though, with all the cool shops in the center.

## 🎯 Focusing on (current obsessions)
- Jekyll (the static site generator powering this website)

---

## 🤓 Learning
- Webflow
- Liquid templating language (for Jekyll)
- Airtable - advanced integrations

---

## 📚 Reading
- Lots of articles on Instapaper (let's me speed read and has built-in Wiktionary support, so I prefer it over Pocket)

---

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. Aiming to log more often without skipping days.
