    Not sure how to feel about Arcane Season 2. I finished it a few days ago and can’t get it out of my head.

    On one hand, a lot of the things I wanted to happen did; but the way everything was handled made the world and the characters within it feel less… real, compared to Season 1 → smaller emotional investment. S2 felt more like a “videogame adaptation”, whereas S1 felt like a standalone storytelling masterpiece that I’d recommend to anyone.

    I still liked it, but the closure felt incomplete because the focus shifted.

Spent the weekend designing and coding a huge overhaul of my website’s homepage and navigation. 

Feedback from a third party drove me to acknowledge the shortcomings I had already noticed, but wished weren’t so bad. It was the small push I needed to make some big changes I’ve had in the back of my mind for a long&nbsp;time.

The thing now is that the other pages look stale (to me) by comparison, and I can’t wait to update them too!

### November 29th, 2024

After years of knowing I should, I added a [“Skip to content” link](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/) to my website. I’m not sure why I put it off for so long. I kinda thought it would take a long time to implement, but it took < 5 minutes… Now if anyone uses a keyboard to navigate my website, they won’t have to tab through 8 (!) nav links to get to the main content!

### October 9th, 2024

This weekend, I pushed a big update to my website’s homepage, regarding how I show previews of the projects I’ve worked on! [Read about it here](/en/portfolio-project-showcase).

I also wrote a [manual for working with me](/{{page.lang}}/manual) after coming across [manualof.me](https://www.manualof.me/about)!

I used ChatGPT + 5 hours to make a Chrome extension that turns my new tab into a grid with bookmarks that can be put into sections!

[It’s live in the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmarks-tab/ofijmedbafaffedkkhpgandnchdnbgoo)! I’m very excited about it because it’s crazy to me how limited the default browser new tabs are regarding how they handle bookmarks and I’ve wanted an alternative for so long!
