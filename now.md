## 📜 Summary
- Currently undergoing some life changes. 
- 🇯🇵 Decided to get serious about learning **Japanese**. Discovered a very helpful YouTube chanel that teaches grammar and watching a few videos every couple of days. Meanwhile, I'm replaying my favorite game of all time *in Japanese* and looking up every word. I managed to learn English that way, so why not Japanese too?

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. It's mainly for tech stuff so it's empty when I'm busy with different things.
