# Now Page

In this page you can find out what is going on in my life at the moment.
Inspired by the [Now Now Now Project](https://nownownow.com/about).

## 🌍 Current Location
Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹

---

## 🎯 Focusing on (current obsessions)
- Jekyll (the static site generator powering this website)

---

## 🤓 Learning
- Webflow
- Liquid templating language (for Jekyll)
- Airtable - advanced integrations

---

## 📚 Reading
- Lots of articles on Instapaper (let's me speed read and has built-in Wiktionary support, so I prefer it over Pocket)

---

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. Sometimes I forget to log tasks for weeks or even months though 😅 Trying to fix that.
