    I uploaded an [overview of the work I've done at Shopflix](/en/shopflix) for the past couple of years. I've been meaning to do that for over a year and finally carved out the time to. It's hard to distill years of work into a concise overview (I might trim it further) and it's even harder when you're under an NDA (I was very inspired by [this designer’s solution](https://yg.is/airtable/)).

    In unrelated news, I’m happy my sudden spike of acne is going away after applying an Azelaic acid cream for over a week.

I made a single-page Progressive Web App (PWA)! It works offline and solves a real issue for me so I’m overjoyed! 
    
I call it [Calorie Grid](https://calorie-grid.netlify.app/) and the idea’s been in my head for years. Now thanks to LLMs like Claude but also being more knowledgeable about JavaScript, I was able to build it in a bit over a day. 

It’s already taught me a lot about JS, but more importantly it’s shown me the importance of understanding every single line of code an LLM writes for you. I knew that already, but it’s painful to try to make a small change yourself only to realize your assumption about how the system works was extremely wrong. Lesson learned!

### January 21st, 2025

Pushing quality of life updates to my website. Check out the loading animation [on the homepage](/)! 
    
Granted, I copied [this awesome animation from Codepen](https://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/GROaam), but it was a great opportunity to learn how to make it fade out smoothly, how to make sure it doesn’t appear if the JS doesn’t load, how to avoid a flash of the page underneath before the loader appears … and to familiarize myself with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)!

Not sure how to feel about Arcane Season 2. I finished it a few days ago and can’t get it out of my head.

On one hand, a lot of the things I wanted to happen did; but the way everything was handled made the world and the characters within it feel less… real, compared to Season 1 → smaller emotional investment. S2 felt more like a “videogame adaptation”, whereas S1 felt like a standalone storytelling masterpiece that I’d recommend to anyone.

I still liked it, but the closure felt incomplete because the focus shifted.

### December 1st, 2024

Spent the weekend designing and coding a huge overhaul of my website’s homepage and navigation. 

Feedback from a third party drove me to acknowledge the shortcomings I had already noticed, but wished weren’t so bad. It was the small push I needed to make some big changes I’ve had in the back of my mind for a long&nbsp;time.

The thing now is that the other pages look stale (to me) by comparison, and I can’t wait to update them too!

### November 29th, 2024

After years of knowing I should, I added a [“Skip to content” link](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-skip-to-content-link/) to my website. I’m not sure why I put it off for so long. I kinda thought it would take a long time to implement, but it took < 5 minutes… Now if anyone uses a keyboard to navigate my website, they won’t have to tab through 8 (!) nav links to get to the main content!

### October 9th, 2024

This weekend, I pushed a big update to my website’s homepage, regarding how I show previews of the projects I’ve worked on! [Read about it here](/en/portfolio-project-showcase).

I also wrote a [manual for working with me](/{{page.lang}}/manual) after coming across [manualof.me](https://www.manualof.me/about)!


### May 23rd, 2024

I used ChatGPT + 5 hours to make a Chrome extension that turns my new tab into a grid with bookmarks that can be put into sections! 

<video autoplay loop muted src="/uploads/bookmarks-2024-05-15.mp4" class="w-100 br3"></video>

[It’s live in the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmarks-tab/ofijmedbafaffedkkhpgandnchdnbgoo)! I’m very excited about it because it’s crazy to me how limited the default browser new tabs are regarding how they handle bookmarks and I’ve wanted an alternative for so long!

## Note

I’ve been writing updates on my `/now` page for a much longer time, and regret that I haven’t been keeping a running log since the beginning. I could theoretically go over all my GitHub commits to populate this page and might do just that at some point.
