* Adjusting to work after the holidays. Focus: design systems, branding.
* Started a couple of short courses, for fun. I missed learning with focused intend.
* I crave reading novels again. Too much non-fiction makes life feel sterile.
* Thought that’s been on my mind lately: the more novel things you do in your lifetime, the longer it’ll feel like you’ve lived.
