This weekend, I pushed a big update to my website’s homepage, regarding how I show previews of the projects I’ve worked on! [Read about it here](/en/portfolio-project-showcase).

I also wrote a [manual for working with me](/{{page.lang}}/manual) after coming across [manualof.me](https://www.manualof.me/about)!

I used ChatGPT + 5 hours to make a Chrome extension that turns my new tab into a grid with bookmarks that can be put into sections!

[It’s live in the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmarks-tab/ofijmedbafaffedkkhpgandnchdnbgoo)! I’m very excited about it because it’s crazy to me how limited the default browser new tabs are regarding how they handle bookmarks and I’ve wanted an alternative for so long!
