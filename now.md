* Came back from a vacation to Chios last week 🏝️🇬🇷
* Want to arrange a long weekend away again soon. 🏖️
* Watching Rick and Morty 😍
* *Finally* added a CSS grid to the [homepage](/en#work) (I’d been using floats as a “temporary” solution for 3 years 🙈)
* Got a [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) invite after *many* months of being on the waitlist. It works great — let me know if you want an invitation!
