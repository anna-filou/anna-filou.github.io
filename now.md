- ~~I’m trying to go out more and do stuff.~~ → *LOL I might have **broken my foot**, so that’s on hold now. I did manage to go rock climbing before that though.* 🧗‍♂️
- Designing for myself in my spare time.
- Getting my thinking in order — trying out [Napkin](https://www.napkin.one/) because I want more clarity.
    - Like, what are my principles on making things? When is it worth making a new piece of software, starting a project, etc.?
- Thinking a lot about work-life balance, what‘s worth it, … that kinda stuff.
- [Reading](/bookshelf/) 12 Rules for Life and finding it very interesting and insightful. I’m only in Chapter 3 but, I’m starting to think the author sometimes jumps to his own conclusions while framing them as objective truths, without taking counterpoints into account. Still interesting to consider.
- I’m also gradually redesigning this website. No huge changes — just some housekeeping and fresh paint, some decorations here and there… It already looks different and I like it.
