# Now Page

In this page you can find out what is going on in my life at the moment.
Inspired by the [Now Now Now Project](https://nownownow.com/about).

---

## 🌍 Current Location
- Athens, Greece 🇬🇷
- Adjusting to living here again and getting back into good habits

---

## 🎯 Focusing on
- Getting some personal/legal/tax issues I've been avoiding sorted
- Organizing personal documents

---

## 🤓 Learning
- Webflow

- Liquid templating language (for Jekyll)
- Airtable - advanced integrations

---

## 📚 Reading
- Lots of articles on Instapaper (let's me speed read and has built-in Wiktionary support, so I prefer it over Pocket)

---

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. Aiming to log more often without skipping days.
