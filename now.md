# Now Page

### What is this page?

It’s more or less the answer to “what are you up to lately?” Learn more about the [Now Now Now project](https://nownownow.com/about).

I **completely redesigned this website** today. It’s 1 A.M. now and I’m finishing up the Jekyll configuration. I think it’s worth sacrificing sleep on rare occassions to get something done. I know I wouldn’t get it done this month if I stopped earlier today.

The site is not perfect by _any_ means but it’s mine. It was mine before, sure, but I’d made it using Webflow and customizing the exported code. This time it’s all mine — unless you count using [Tachyons CSS](tachyons.io) as cheating? I think it’s more of a very convenient shortcut.

Anyway, it’s still a WIP and I’ll keep adding pages and info, but the groundwork has been laid. My ambition is to have a flexible website that I can easily customize as time goes on and upload new works — which was time consuming before because I hadn’t baked it into the site from the beginning.

I finally know what I’m doing!

PS: It switches between light and dark mode depending on the visitor’s system setting 🧡

The last time I updated this page was a few days before my dad died. Almost 6 months ago. Crazy how much my life has changed in such a short amount of time.

Despite the obvious struggles, there's a lot I'm thankful for.

* 💚 I'm healthy and fit
* ❤️ The people I love are healthy and fit
* 👫👭 I spend quality time with my friends every week
* ⛸️ I started roller skating (coming from a background of ice skating)!
* 👨‍💻 I got a full-time job I enjoy
* 🇯🇵 My Japanese has improved to the point where I can play Japanese games and roughly understand what's going on 😅

Life can be really bad.

And really good.
