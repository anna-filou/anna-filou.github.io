# Now Page

In this page you can find out what is going on in my life at the moment.
Inspired by the [Now Now Now Project](https://nownownow.com/about).

## 📜 General

* 👩🏻‍💻 Lots of work, everything else is kind of paused.
* 💪🏻 Still finding time to workout.
* 👩🏻‍🎨 I want to redesign my own portfolio because it's not a reflection of my current skills but 1) I can't decide what kind of impression I want visitors to get and 2) it's not as important as my current projects.

## 📖 Learning

* [Forestry CMS](forestry.io) (in fact, I used that to update this very post!) because I need to give clients an easy way to edit the websites I make, but I don't want to involve rented servers and create dependencies (if you remove Forestry from a website, nothing will change because it's Git-based).
* The next SSG I want to learn to use is [11ty](https://github.com/vwochnik/jekyll-email-protect). Seems like everyone's raving about it. I found an interesting looking course and wanna give it a go but I'm not very familiar with JavaScript… Seems I'll be learning that as well.

## 💭 Thoughts

I constantly learn all sorts of different things but don't take the necessary time to get **really good** at any single thing… I mean, I've certainly learned a lot by doing this over many years, but perhaps I need to take some time off of learning random stuff and “specialize” for a while. Then I can go back to learning other things. Easy in theory, hard in practice.
