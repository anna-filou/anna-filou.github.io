**🗓 Latest Update: {{ page.date }}**

I'm trying to balance feeling overburdened by the amount of work I've committed to, with trying to enjoy my life with my friends while I still have the chance.

I keep coming back to the idea that I'll need to drastically alter my lifestyle, if I want to preserve the positivity I've been experiencing lately and alleviate the pressure that’s built up over the years. 

## In a few points

* 🏞️ Been going out and doing stuff for a change.
* 🇳🇱 Learning Dutch is going well! 🇯🇵 on hold for now but trying to not forget.
* ✏️ Note to self: don’t **ever** take on more than 2 projects again when already working full-time. Feeling so overwhelmed and restricted just isn’t worth it.
* 🏖️ Looking forward to vacation but can’t help thinking: I can’t keep putting everyone on hold for 11+ months and living for <1 month a year for the rest of my life.

## An older update, April 16, 2021

I completely redesigned this website today. It’s 1 A.M. now and I’m finishing up the Jekyll configuration. I think it’s worth sacrificing sleep on rare occassions to get something done. I know I wouldn’t get it done this month if I stopped earlier today.

The site is not perfect by any means but it’s mine. It was mine before, sure, but I’d made it using Webflow and customizing the exported code. This time it’s all mine — unless you count using [Tachyons CSS](https://annafilou.com/now/tachyons.io) as cheating? I think it’s more of a very convenient shortcut.

Anyway, it’s still a WIP and I’ll keep adding pages and info, but the groundwork has been laid. My ambition is to have a flexible website that I can easily customize as time goes on and upload new works — which was time consuming before because I hadn’t baked it into the site from the beginning.

I finally know what I’m doing!

PS: It switches between light and dark mode depending on the visitor’s system setting 🧡
