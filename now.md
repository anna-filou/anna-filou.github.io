In this page you can find out what is going on in my life at the moment.
Inspired by the [Now Now Now Project](https://nownownow.com/about).

## 📜 Summary
- Getting back into **exercise**. I realized quite some time ago that I've lost muscle mass. I'm still a relatively fit, but it's as they say: *«use it or lose it»*. If I don't use my muscles regularly and extensively, one day I won't be *able* to use them, despite wanting to. For that reason I'm prioritizing my health now.
- I recently learned how to use **Figma**! It's great and I'm sad I didn't try it out sooner!
- Thinking about **writing** (or rather, posting the things that I write) more often (as in, more than once a year 😆). I'm a bit scared they're not good enough but how would I improve otherwise?
On that note, I might add a blog section (perhaps titled «thoughts») to this website, but I need to restructure the navigation bar 🤔

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. It's mainly for tech stuff so it's empty when I'm busy with different things.

That's it for now! I try to keep this updated as much as I can.
