This weekend, I spent over 10 hours (!) making what started out as a “quick update” to my portfolio 🥲

[Read about that here](/en/portfolio-project-showcase) and [let me know](/en/contact) if it was worth it! 🙏🏻

I also wrote a [manual for working with me](/{{page.lang}}/manual) after coming across [manualof.me](https://www.manualof.me/about)!

I used ChatGPT + 5 hours to make a Chrome extension that turns my new tab into a grid with bookmarks that can be put into sections!

[It’s live in the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmarks-tab/ofijmedbafaffedkkhpgandnchdnbgoo)! I’m very excited about it because it’s crazy to me how limited the default browser new tabs are regarding how they handle bookmarks and I’ve wanted an alternative for so long!
