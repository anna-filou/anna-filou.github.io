## 📜 Summary

After experiencing a moderate mental health crisis, I feel I understand myself better. 
I'm currently spending a lot of time educating myself on my particular issue and mental health in general. 

Technically I guess I'm "wasting" time that could otherwise be productive, but the goal of life IMO is to be happy and healthy for as long as possible.

## 📖 Reading
- **Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don't Have To** by David A. Sinclair PhD, Matthew D. LaPlant

    **Note:** I'm young but I don't want to die 🙃

## 📚 Recently Finished
- **It** by Stephen King

    **Opinion:** very nice story + I feel like I got some insights into humanity's nature, BUT there are a LOT of unnecessary details, the book could have been 400 pages long instead of 1000.

## 🎎 Random
- I recently tried meal replacement drinks 🥛 for the first time and they are so awesome! 🤩 It saves so much time and brain power to not have to think about what you're going to eat each day for breakfast or lunch.

## ✅ Doing
Here are my most recent [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/about) achievements. It's mainly for tech stuff so it's empty when I'm busy with different things.
