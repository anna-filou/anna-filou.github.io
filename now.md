## What is this page?

It’s more or less the answer to “what are you up to lately?” Learn more about the [Now Now Now project](https://nownownow.com/about).

***

The last time I updated this page was a few days before my dad died. Almost 6 months ago. Crazy how much my life has changed in such a short amount of time.

Despite the obvious struggles, there's a lot I'm thankful for.

* 💚 I'm healthy and fit
* ❤️ The people I love are healthy and fit
* 👫👭 I spend quality time with my friends every week
* ⛸️ I started roller skating (coming from a background of ice skating)!
* 👨‍💻 I got a full-time job I enjoy
* 🇯🇵 My Japanese has improved to the point where I can play Japanese games and roughly understand what's going on 😅

Life can be really bad. And really good. It'll always be like that.
