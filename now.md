* Attempting to enjoy the holidays, for once ❤️
* Working out at home instead of the gym due to recovering from a foot injury (upper body only, focusing on shoulders and back)
* Getting my thinking in order — trying out [Napkin](https://www.napkin.one/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
* Thinking a lot about work-life balance and what I want for the future.
* Making my own task management system in Coda (and designing my dream interface for it on and off in my spare time).
* [Reading](/reading/) 
  * _Shoe Dog_ (auto-biography of the founder of Nike. Surprisingly engrossing and well-written!) 
  * _12 Rules for Life_ paused, next up
