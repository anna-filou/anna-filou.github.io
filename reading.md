- title: Design Is a Job: The Necessary Second Edition
  cover: "/assets/books/design-is-a-job.webp"
  author: Mike Monteiro
  read: '2025'
  pages: 150
  my-notes:   |-
      Almost as funny as ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre My Favorite Client‚Äô by the same author. I‚Äôd recommend reading this both for the practical tips and for a boost in your determination to do good‚Äîboth good work and good in the world.

      It isn‚Äôt strictly about the business of design (the first edition was more focused on that), but rather a human-to-human exchange of knowledge and convictions. I personally appreciate that and admire people who take a stand, though it was unexpected.

  my-notes:   |-
      *‚ÄúWhen we build websites or apps, we often wait until the last minute to bring in designers to ‚Äòapply‚Äô design, or look and feel. This is akin to baking a cake and then hiring a baker to make it taste good.‚Äù*

      I laughed SO hard on every other page! üòÇ But I also had a lot of aha-moments and ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs why that happened back then and this is how I could have done better‚Äù. 
- title: Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships
  cover: "/assets/books/unwritten-rules.webp"
  author: Temple Grandin & Sean Barron 
  read: '2025'
  pages: 425
  my-notes:   |-
      I was looking for a social cheat sheet, and while this was written for neurotypical adults who work with autistic children, it was still helpful. Reading things I was technically already aware of, but explained by people who think like me, was far more impactful. Some of it was informative and some useful, but a lot felt like giving up your values just to conform. I refuse to do that. 
- title: "Animal Farm: The Graphic Novel"
  cover: "/assets/books/animal-farm-graphic-novel.webp"
  author: George Orwell, adapted by Odyr
  read: '2025'
  pages: 176
  my-notes:   |-
      Been meaning to read Animal Farm for years, never got around to it. Stumbled upon this beautiful adaptation in a bookstore and read it all on the spot.

      It made me sad. Now I wanna read the actual book more than before. Wonder if it has more details. How do you go from egalitatian to totalitarian? It felt kinda‚Ä¶ fake in the graphic novel. Like it could not possibly happen for real. But it does!
- title: $100M Offers
  cover: "/assets/books/100m-offers.webp"
  author: Alex Hormozi
  read: '2025'
  pages: 258
  my-notes:   |-
      Loved some parts (e.g. ‚ÄúWhen you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product‚Äù), hated some others (e.g. ‚Äúif you wouldn‚Äôt club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don‚Äôt have to pay a penny‚Äù‚Äîyes, I assume it‚Äôs a joke, but it still makes me sick).

      Overall, I‚Äôm glad I read this and was exposed to a new perspective‚Äîthat‚Äôs the point of reading books! While I agree with the author on many philosophical points, I‚Äôm not convinced that fully embracing the capitalist system we live in is the best way forward as a society.
- title: Pricing Design
  cover: "/assets/books/pricing-design.webp"
  author: Dan Mall
  read: '2025'
  pages: 58
  my-notes:   |-
      I love this way of thinking about pricing projects: how do we make it so that it‚Äôs both a steal for you and lucrative for me? In other words, how do we both win? 

      Just pondering this question can help us figure out what we really need from a project and how to get it.

      A short read anyone would benefit from. [Read it online here](https://pricingdesignbook.com/#introduction).

  cover: "/assets/books/psychopolitics.webp"
  author: Byung-Chul Han
  pages: 96
  my-notes:   |-
      *‚ÄúUnder neoliberalism, the technology of power takes on a subtle form. It does not lay hold of individuals directly. Instead, it ensures that individuals act on themselves so that power relations are interiorized‚Äîand then interpreted as&nbsp;freedom.‚Äù*
      
      Not the kind of book I would normally read if it hadn't been personally recommended. None of the ideas strikes me as completely new, but they are well-developed and thought-provoking. That said, I found the language unnecessarily difficult and had to look up a lot of words. The author also assumes that you're familiar with the writings of various philosophers that I hadn't even heard of; but that makes it a nice introduction for further&nbsp;reading.

  my-notes:   |-
    A timeline and critical historical overview of the current state of startup culture.

    I often found myself chuckling and thinking ‚ÄúI can't believe nobody else is pointing out how absurd this is!‚Äù Not only did I learn a lot more about how the economy works, I was also highly entertained.
- title: You Can Negotiate Anything
  read: '2024'
  cover: "/assets/books/you-can-negotiate-anything.webp"
  author: Herb Cohen
  pages: 256
  my-notes:   |-
    I can see there‚Äôs value in the insights within, but many of the anecdotes are a bit hard to believe. 
    
    Overall the book was highly entertaining! Whether it‚Äôll prove to be helpful remains to be seen, but I‚Äôd definitelly like my attitude to be more like author‚Äôs.
- title: Business Thinking For Designers
  read: '2024'
  cover: "/assets/books/business-thinking-for-designers.webp"
  author: Ryan Rumsey
  pages: 156
  my-notes:   |- 
    I know that if I‚Äôm going to a be a better designer, I need to learn as much as I can about the business side of things. In our current system, great design is not made for the sake of it, but to achieve business goals‚Äîwhether or not that‚Äôs what what personally drives me. 
    
    After reading this book and connecting the insights to my personal struggles, I feel better equiped to navigate the corporate world and partner with business leaders to build great designs that push goals&nbsp;forward.
- title: How to design better UI Components
  read: '2024'
  cover: "/assets/books/how-to-design-better-ui-components.webp"
  author: Adrian Kuleszo
  pages: 197
  my-notes:   |-
    Honestly, I was hoping I‚Äôd get some tips to take my designs to the next level, but the book only contained information and advice that I already knew. I feel that it was falsely advertised as suitable for more advanced designers in addition to beginners, and it‚Äôs my fault for not seeing through that.

    I‚Äôd say the book is mostly a marketing tool for the authors‚Äô more expensive book.

    It‚Äôs so long that it counts as a book, OK??
- title: Atomic Design
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/assets/books/atomic-design.jpg"
  author: Brad Frost
  pages: 198
  my-notes:   |-
    Amazing, wonderful, concise, and entertaining! Although I've been familiar with the overall concept for years, taking the time to read this short book from start to finish has been enlightening and empowering.

    It helps that I began applying the insights at work while still reading it. The best way to keep newly acquired knowledge is to use it right away.
- title: '1984'
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/assets/books/1984.jpg"
  author: George Orwell
  pages: 368
  my-notes:   |- 
    *‚ÄúPower is not a means, it is an end.‚Äù*

    Extremely well written and gripping. But it also made me sick and, at times, prevented me from falling asleep.

    *‚ÄúTo die hating them, that was freedom.‚Äù*
- title: 12 Rules for Life
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/uploads/12-rules-for-life.jpg"
  author: Jordan B. Peterson
  pages: 320
  my-notes:  |- 
    I wasn‚Äôt aware of the controversy surrounding Jordan Peterson when I started reading this book, but still noticed how he seemed to present some of his personal opinions as scientific fact (e.g. supposedly innate psychological difference between men and women), even though in most other cases he uses references to base his arguments on. 
    
    Despite its flaws, this is a good book, because it makes you think about various topics which we don‚Äôt usually discuss.
- title: Learn To Code Now
  cover: "/assets/books/learn-to-code-now-superhi.jpg"
  author: Rik Lomas
  read: '2023'
  pages: 446
  my-notes: "I actually started this way back in 2021‚Ä¶ Then I chickened out once I
    reached the chapter on JavaScript. (I needn‚Äôt be afraid.) Fast forward to January
    2023, when I needed to learn some JavaScript *fast*, and I finished it in two
    days.\n\nThis book definitely **supercharged my confidence in coding** and it
    was genuinely fun to read! That said, it‚Äôs full of typos and even has some omissions.
    I‚Äôd expect someone would have corrected those, since it‚Äôs a paid guide. "
- title: The Magic Fish

  cover: "/uploads/book-the-magic-fish.jpg"
  author: Trung Le Nguyen
  pages: 256
  my-notes: Incredible graphic novel. I love fairy tales; I wasn't expecting these
    ones would be so gripping. The illustration is breathtaking and the storytelling
    keeps you at the edge of your seat. I felt happiness, sadness and anger, all in
    a short span of time.
- title: Shoe Dog
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/assets/books/shoe-dog.jpg"
  author: Phil Knight
  pages: 400
  my-notes: Incredibly well-written and captivating from the very first page. If you‚Äôd
    told me 3 months ago that an auto-biography would be among my favorite books ever,
    I would have laughed, but here we are. I highlighted over 20.000 words and feel
    a renewed drive to live and try things.

  author: Maia Kobabe
  pages: 239
  my-notes: |-
    Gender Queer is **the** most banned book in the US, and I was curious to see why. Well, I'm just embarrassed to be human. (Let's stop pretending children don't have genitals, shall&nbsp;we?)

    Anyhow, this work is informative and helpful, full of relatable private moments we don‚Äôt often get a glimpse of in others.
- title: Two Boys Kissing
  cover: "/assets/books/two-boys-kissing.jpg"
  author: David Levithan
  read: '2022'
  pages: 239
  my-notes: |-
    Surprisingly rebatable at times. Once I neared the ending, I stayed up
    late to finish it. It made my heart beat faster, gave me reason to feel grateful
    and provided food for thought in the form of ample quotable passages.

    *‚ÄúThey hold hands, feel like they are witnessing something monumental, something that
    could change things. It won‚Äôt, but that feeling, that spirit will live on in everyone
    here, everyone who sees. The spirit will change things.‚Äù*
- title: It's Not How Good You Are‚Ä¶
  cover: "/assets/books/its-not-how-good-you-are.jpg"
  author: Paul Arden
  read: '2022'
  pages: 128
  my-notes: |-
    This book's typesetting was gorgeous! Large, legible print on appealing pages.

    I assumed it was a self-help book when I saw the title.
    It turns out it‚Äôs a business book‚Äîand a good one at that.

    Super quick read (few pages, big letters). I know I‚Äôll need to come back to it often to instill the teachings into my head.
- title: How to Find the Right Words
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-how-to-find-the-right-words.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 76
  my-notes: "*‚ÄúWe want to let others know how we feel. And we want to be kind. Only
    too often, the two missions seem entirely opposed.‚Äù*\n\nOne could call this book
    a short introduction to practical psychology. It's the opposite of theoretical
    by providing exemplary confessions and breaking them down phrase by phrase, explaining
    along the way what makes them ideal. \n\nI strongly disagree with some of the
    authors‚Äô advice, but considering views you don't agree with helps you see situations
    from others‚Äô points of view."
- title: When Breath Becomes Air

  pages: 208
  my-notes: |-
    ‚Äú[E]ven if I‚Äôm dying, until I actually die, I am still living.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúAs a doctor, I had had some sense of what patients with life-changing illnesses faced‚Äîand it was exactly these moments I had wanted to explore with them. Shouldn‚Äôt terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death?‚Äù

    ‚ÄúEven if you are perfect, the world isn‚Äôt. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win.‚Äù
- title: The Mindbody Prescription
  cover: "/assets/books/mindbody-prescription.jpg"
  author: John E. Sarno M.D.
  read: '2022'
  pages: 240
  my-notes: This was a slow read with multiple breaks. The content was insightful
    but I don't currently suffer from any pain. Nevertheless, I think reading this
    is good prevention. Everyone should read this book or a summary of it to be aware
    of all the serious trouble that the mind can birth in the body. As the author
    supports, there really is no separation between the mind and body. The title sounds
    misleadingly gimmicky, but the book is not.
- title: The Tiny MBA
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-tiny-mba.png"
  author: Alex Hillman
  pages: 128
  my-notes: More of a collection of cards than a book. I feel like I'll be going back
    to it frequently, as the author advises. On my first read-through, I didn't have
    a breakthrough, but I do feel like some seeds were planted. The pages within are
    prompts for the reader to reflect on.
- title: The Song of Achilles

  author: Madeline Miller
  pages: 416
  my-notes: |-
    *‚ÄúI wish he had let you all die.‚Äù*

    There are many aspects of this book that I didn‚Äôt like, including the tone of voice, the frequent use of cheesy metaphors, and the lack of realism in the descriptions of ancient Greece. But in the end, I cried a little and that has to count for something.

    (Reading The Song of Achilles taught me way more about the Iliad than secondary school in Greece.)

- title: What They Forgot to Teach You at School
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-in-school.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 144
  my-notes: |-
    *‚ÄúTo the surprise of any visiting alien, humans blithely educate themselves as if the chief requirement of adulthood were the possession of a set of technical skills, with no acknowledgement of the fact that what mostly runs us into the sands is ‚Ä¶ our inability to master what we could call the emotional dimensions of our lives.‚Äù*

    An honest, condensed book. I think everyone should read it as early in their life as possible. I'm happy that a lot of the advice doesn't seem to apply to me, but gives me more tools to understand others.
- title: Calm
  cover: "/assets/books/calm-the-school-of-life.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  read: '2022'
  pages: 136
  my-notes: |-
    ‚ÄúA calm life isn‚Äôt one that‚Äôs always perfectly serene. It is one where we are committed to calming down more readily, and where we strive for more realistic expectations; where we can understand better why certain problems are occurring, and we can be more adept at finding a consoling perspective.‚Äù

    ‚ÄúYou will die and it will be as if you had never been. It could sound demeaning. But these are generous sentiments, for we otherwise so easily exaggerate our own importance and suffer accordingly.‚Äù
- title: Relationships
  read: '2021'
  cover: "/uploads/book-school-of-life-relationships.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 118
  my-notes: "This might be the most well-written book I've ever read. It's not unnecessarily
    wordy, but rather goes straight to the point while still providing examples vivid
    enough to drive the point home. \n\nI feel I now have the vocabulary to talk about
    concepts that I couldn't before ‚Äî at least not well enough. It's been interesting
    reading about a different perspective and discovering that some of my beliefs
    and values might not be mine at all, but are heavily influenced by the dominant
    culture of our time."
- title: Shape Up

  cover: "/uploads/book-shape-up.jpg"
  author: Ryan Singer (Basecamp)
  pages: 172
  my-notes: Enlightening, even though I was already familiar with the concepts. The
    book presents a set of mental tools and explains their benefits. Armed with those,
    I feel much more confident in defining and bringing projects to life. This approach
    makes a lot of sense in theory‚ÄîI aim to try it for myself in the near future.
- title: Call Me by Your Name

  my-notes: "Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology
    and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit
    mixed but overall I think I‚Äôve gained something valuable. \U0001F499\n"

I use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, starting in 2021, in a way that makes sense to me.
