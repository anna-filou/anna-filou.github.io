    “A calm life isn’t one that’s always perfectly serene. It is one where we are committed to calming down more readily, and where we strive for more realistic expectations; where we can understand better why certain problems are occurring, and we can be more adept at finding a consoling perspective.”

    “You will die and it will be as if you had never been. It could sound demeaning. But these are generous sentiments, for we otherwise so easily exaggerate our own importance and suffer accordingly.”

  my-notes: "This might be the most well-written book I've ever read. It's not unnecessarily
    wordy, but rather goes straight to the point while still providing examples vivid
    enough to drive the point home. \n\nI feel I now have the vocabulary to talk about
    concepts that I couldn't before — at least not well enough. It's been interesting
    reading about a different perspective and discovering that some of my beliefs
    and values might not be mine at all, but are heavily influenced by the dominant
    culture of our time."

  my-notes: Enlightening, even though I was already familiar with the concepts. The
    book presents a set of mental tools and explains their benefits. Armed with those,
    I feel much more confident in defining and bringing projects to life. This approach
    makes a lot of sense in theory—I aim to try it for myself in the near future.

  my-notes: "Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology
    and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit
    mixed but overall I think I’ve gained something valuable. \U0001F499\n"

I use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, in a way that makes sense to me. If it helps you discover a book you’d like to read, that’d be awesome!

I probably won’t add books I finished before 2021.
