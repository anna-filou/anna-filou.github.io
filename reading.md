  author: Brad Frost
  pages: 198
  my-notes:   |-
    Amazing, wonderful, concise, and entertaining! Although I've been familiar with the overall concept for years, taking the time to read this short book from start to finish has been enlightening and empowering.

    It helps that I began applying the insights at work while still reading it. The best way to keep newly acquired knowledge is to use it right away.
- title: 1984
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/assets/books/1984.jpg"
  author: George Orwell
  pages: 368
  my-notes:   |- 
    *“Power is not a means, it is an end.”*

    Extremely well written and gripping. But it also made me sick and, at times, prevented me from falling asleep.

    *“To die hating them, that was freedom.”*
- title: 12 Rules for Life
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/uploads/12-rules-for-life.jpg"
  author: Jordan B. Peterson
  pages: 320
  my-notes:  |- 
    I wasn’t aware of the controversy surrounding Jordan Peterson when I started reading this book, but still noticed how he seemed to present some of his personal opinions as scientific fact (e.g. supposedly innate psychological difference between men and women), even though in most other cases he uses references to base his arguments on. 
    
    Despite its flaws, this is a good book, because it makes you think about various topics which we don’t usually discuss.
- title: Learn To Code Now
  cover: "/assets/books/learn-to-code-now-superhi.jpg"
  author: Rik Lomas
  read: '2023'
  pages: 446
  my-notes: "I actually started this way back in 2021… Then I chickened out once I
    reached the chapter on JavaScript. (I needn’t be afraid.) Fast forward to January
    2023, when I needed to learn some JavaScript *fast*, and I finished it in two
    days.\n\nThis book definitely **supercharged my confidence in coding** and it
    was genuinely fun to read! That said, it’s full of typos and even has some omissions.
    I’d expect someone would have corrected those, since it’s a paid guide. "
- title: The Magic Fish
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-the-magic-fish.jpg"
  author: Trung Le Nguyen
  pages: 256
  my-notes: Incredible graphic novel. I love fairy tales; I wasn't expecting these
    ones would be so gripping. The illustration is breathtaking and the storytelling
    keeps you at the edge of your seat. I felt happiness, sadness and anger, all in
    a short span of time.
- title: Shoe Dog
  read: '2023'
  cover: "/assets/books/shoe-dog.jpg"
  author: Phil Knight
  pages: 400
  my-notes: Incredibly well-written and captivating from the very first page. If you’d
    told me 3 months ago that an auto-biography would be among my favorite books ever,
    I would have laughed, but here we are. I highlighted over 20.000 words and feel
    a renewed drive to live and try things.

- title: Gender Queer
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/gender-queer-book.jpg"
  author: Maia Kobabe
  pages: 239
  my-notes: |-
    Gender Queer is **the** most banned book in the US, and I was curious to see why. Well, I'm just embarrassed to be human. (Let's stop pretending children don't have genitals, shall&nbsp;we?)

    Anyhow, this work is informative and helpful, full of relatable private moments we don’t often get a glimpse of in others.
- title: Two Boys Kissing
  cover: "/assets/books/two-boys-kissing.jpg"
  author: David Levithan
  read: '2022'
  pages: 239
  my-notes: |-
    Surprisingly rebatable at times. Once I neared the ending, I stayed up
    late to finish it. It made my heart beat faster, gave me reason to feel grateful
    and provided food for thought in the form of ample quotable passages.

    *“They hold hands, feel like they are witnessing something monumental, something that
    could change things. It won’t, but that feeling, that spirit will live on in everyone
    here, everyone who sees. The spirit will change things.”*
- title: It's Not How Good You Are…
  cover: "/assets/books/its-not-how-good-you-are.jpg"
  author: Paul Arden
  read: '2022'
  pages: 128
  my-notes: |-
    This book's typesetting was gorgeous! Large, legible print on appealing pages.

    I assumed it was a self-help book when I saw the title.
    It turns out it’s a business book—and a good one at that.

    Super quick read (few pages, big letters). I know I’ll need to come back to it often to instill the teachings into my head.
- title: How to Find the Right Words
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-how-to-find-the-right-words.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 76
  my-notes: "*“We want to let others know how we feel. And we want to be kind. Only
    too often, the two missions seem entirely opposed.”*\n\nOne could call this book
    a short introduction to practical psychology. It's the opposite of theoretical
    by providing exemplary confessions and breaking them down phrase by phrase, explaining
    along the way what makes them ideal. \n\nI strongly disagree with some of the
    authors’ advice, but considering views you don't agree with helps you see situations
    from others’ points of view."
- title: When Breath Becomes Air
  cover: "/assets/books/when-breath-becomes-air.jpg"
  author: Paul Kalanithi
  read: '2022'
  pages: 208
  my-notes: |-
    “[E]ven if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”

    “As a doctor, I had had some sense of what patients with life-changing illnesses faced—and it was exactly these moments I had wanted to explore with them. Shouldn’t terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death?”

    “Even if you are perfect, the world isn’t. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win.”
- title: The Mindbody Prescription
  cover: "/assets/books/mindbody-prescription.jpg"
  author: John E. Sarno M.D.
  read: '2022'
  pages: 240
  my-notes: This was a slow read with multiple breaks. The content was insightful
    but I don't currently suffer from any pain. Nevertheless, I think reading this
    is good prevention. Everyone should read this book or a summary of it to be aware
    of all the serious trouble that the mind can birth in the body. As the author
    supports, there really is no separation between the mind and body. The title sounds
    misleadingly gimmicky, but the book is not.
- title: The Tiny MBA
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-tiny-mba.png"
  author: Alex Hillman
  pages: 128
  my-notes: More of a collection of cards than a book. I feel like I'll be going back
    to it frequently, as the author advises. On my first read-through, I didn't have
    a breakthrough, but I do feel like some seeds were planted. The pages within are
    prompts for the reader to reflect on.
- title: The Song of Achilles
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-the-song-of-achilles.jpg"
  author: Madeline Miller
  pages: 416
  my-notes: |-
    *“I wish he had let you all die.”*

    There are many aspects of this book that I didn’t like, including the tone of voice, the frequent use of cheesy metaphors, and the lack of realism in the descriptions of ancient Greece. But in the end, I cried a little and that has to count for something.

    (Reading The Song of Achilles taught me way more about the Iliad than secondary school in Greece.)

- title: What They Forgot to Teach You at School
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-in-school.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 144
  my-notes: |-
    *“To the surprise of any visiting alien, humans blithely educate themselves as if the chief requirement of adulthood were the possession of a set of technical skills, with no acknowledgement of the fact that what mostly runs us into the sands is … our inability to master what we could call the emotional dimensions of our lives.”*

    An honest, condensed book. I think everyone should read it as early in their life as possible. I'm happy that a lot of the advice doesn't seem to apply to me, but gives me more tools to understand others.
- title: Calm
  cover: "/assets/books/calm-the-school-of-life.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  read: '2022'
  pages: 136
  my-notes: |-
    “A calm life isn’t one that’s always perfectly serene. It is one where we are committed to calming down more readily, and where we strive for more realistic expectations; where we can understand better why certain problems are occurring, and we can be more adept at finding a consoling perspective.”

    “You will die and it will be as if you had never been. It could sound demeaning. But these are generous sentiments, for we otherwise so easily exaggerate our own importance and suffer accordingly.”
- title: Relationships
  read: '2021'
  cover: "/uploads/book-school-of-life-relationships.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 118
  my-notes: "This might be the most well-written book I've ever read. It's not unnecessarily
    wordy, but rather goes straight to the point while still providing examples vivid
    enough to drive the point home. \n\nI feel I now have the vocabulary to talk about
    concepts that I couldn't before — at least not well enough. It's been interesting
    reading about a different perspective and discovering that some of my beliefs
    and values might not be mine at all, but are heavily influenced by the dominant
    culture of our time."
- title: Shape Up
  read: '2021'
  cover: "/uploads/book-shape-up.jpg"
  author: Ryan Singer (Basecamp)
  pages: 172
  my-notes: Enlightening, even though I was already familiar with the concepts. The
    book presents a set of mental tools and explains their benefits. Armed with those,
    I feel much more confident in defining and bringing projects to life. This approach
    makes a lot of sense in theory—I aim to try it for myself in the near future.
- title: Call Me by Your Name
  cover: "/assets/books/call-me-by-your-name.jpg"
  author: André Aciman
  pages: 256
  read: '2021'
  my-notes: "Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology
    and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit
    mixed but overall I think I’ve gained something valuable. \U0001F499\n"

I use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, starting in 2021, in a way that makes sense to me.
