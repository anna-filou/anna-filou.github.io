intro: |
    I intend to use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, in a way that makes sense to me. If it helps you discover a book you’d like to read too, that’d be awesome.

    Probably won’t add books I finished before 2021.
books-2021:

    pages: 256
    my-notes: | 
        It feels like this book is full of truths and advice that one would otherwise have to spend a lifetime collecting. And it’s all here, condensed and ready to process.
