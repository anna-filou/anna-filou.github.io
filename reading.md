- title: The Tiny MBA
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-tiny-mba.png"
  author: Alex Hillman
  pages: 128
  my-notes: More of a collection of cards than a book. I feel that I’ll be revisiting
    it at regular intervals, like the author suggests. I didn't have a breakthrough
    on my first read-through but I feel like some sprouts were planted in my head.
    The ideas here are prompts for you to reflect on.
- title: The Song of Achilles
  read: '2022'

  author: Madeline Miller
  pages: 416

    *“I wish he had let you all die.”*

    There’s a lot I did not like about this book: the tone of voice, the often cringey metaphors and the descriptions of ancient Greece not feeling real enough, among others. But in the end, I cried a little and that has to count for something.

    I learned way more about the Iliad by reading the Song of Achilles than I ever did in (Greek) school.

- title: What They Forgot to Teach You at School
  read: '2022'
  cover: "/uploads/book-what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-in-school.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 144
  my-notes: |-
    *“To the surprise of any visiting alien, humans blithely educate themselves as if the chief requirement of adulthood were the possession of a set of technical skills, with no acknowledgement of the fact that what mostly runs us into the sands is … our inability to master what we could call the emotional dimensions of our lives.”*

    An honest, condensed book. I think everyone should read it as early in their life as possible. I'm happy that a lot of the advice doesn't seem to apply to me, but gives me more tools to understand others.
- title: Calm
  cover: "/assets/books/calm-the-school-of-life.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  read: '2022'
  pages: 136
  my-notes: |-
    “A calm life isn’t one that’s always perfectly serene. It is one where we are committed to calming down more readily, and where we strive for more realistic expectations; where we can understand better why certain problems are occurring, and we can be more adept at finding a consoling perspective.”

    “You will die and it will be as if you had never been. It could sound demeaning. But these are generous sentiments, for we otherwise so easily exaggerate our own importance and suffer accordingly.”
- title: Relationships
  read: '2021'
  cover: "/uploads/book-school-of-life-relationships.jpg"
  author: The School of Life
  pages: 118
  my-notes: "This might be the most well-written book I've ever read. It's not unnecessarily
    wordy, but rather goes straight to the point while still providing examples vivid
    enough to drive the point home. \n\nI feel I now have the vocabulary to talk about
    concepts that I couldn't before — at least not well enough. It's been interesting
    reading about a different perspective and discovering that some of my beliefs
    and values might not be mine at all, but are heavily influenced by the dominant
    culture of our time."
- title: Shape Up
  read: '2021'
  cover: "/uploads/book-shape-up.jpg"
  author: Ryan Singer (Basecamp)
  pages: 172
  my-notes: Enlightening, even though I was already familiar with the concepts. The
    book presents a set of mental tools and explains their benefits. Armed with those,
    I feel much more confident in defining and bringing projects to life. This approach
    makes a lot of sense in theory—I aim to try it for myself in the near future.
- title: Call Me by Your Name
  cover: "/assets/books/call-me-by-your-name.jpg"
  author: André Aciman
  pages: 256
  read: '2021'
  my-notes: "Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology
    and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit
    mixed but overall I think I’ve gained something valuable. \U0001F499\n"

I use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, in a way that makes sense to me. If it helps you discover a book you’d like to read, that’d be awesome!

I probably won’t add books I finished before 2021.
