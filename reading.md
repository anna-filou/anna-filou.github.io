  my-notes: Enlightening, even though I was already familiar with the concepts. The
    book presents a set of mental tools and explains their benefits. Armed with those,
    I feel much more confident in defining and bringing projects to life. This approach
    makes a lot of sense in theory—I aim to try it for myself in the near future.

  my-notes: "Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology
    and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit
    mixed but overall I think I’ve gained something valuable. \U0001F499\n"

I use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, in a way that makes sense to me. If it helps you discover a book you’d like to read, that’d be awesome!

I probably won’t add books I finished before 2021.
