title: Reading
intro: |
    I intend to use this page as a way to keep track of the books I read, in a way that makes sense to me. If it helps you discover a book you’d like to read too, that’d be awesome.

    Probably won’t add books I finished before 2021.
books-2021:
  - title: Call Me by Your Name

    author: André Aciman
    pages: 256
    my-notes: | 
        Despite being a quick read, this book is full of insights on human psychology and advice that one would have to spend years collecting. My feelings are a bit mixed but overall I think it’s shifted my perspective and that I’ve gained something valuable.

        ♥️
