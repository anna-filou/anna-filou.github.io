<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a writer. I was hesitant about posting my thoughts online because the Internet is already over-saturated with content. What more could I add?</p>

<p>But lately it seems that most articles are just part of some company’s “content marketing.” It&#8217;s getting rare to find people who write because they have something to say.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m under no illusion that my thoughts are groundbreaking. Nevertheless I hope you find some of them interesting.</p>
